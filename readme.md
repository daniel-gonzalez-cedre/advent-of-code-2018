My attempt at Advent of Code 2018.
This is primarily for gaining experience with Python and Haskell (and maybe Nim).
As a result, solutions will mostly be in Python or Haskell, even if it would be more efficient to use a faster language like C or C++.
Eventually, I may update more optimal solutions to some problems.
